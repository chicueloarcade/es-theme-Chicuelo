All the art of this project was created by hand by me and is protected by copyright law, which I stipulate through this document which may be freely distributed as long as it is not for any commercial means or included in any product for the same purpose.


# Info:
This design was intended to make a more beautiful and clean experience, with no floating characters, consoles or sprites around the screen.
Just the esencial and trying to make a professional and minimal interface, but with a nice impact.
Every system has an iconic game and character so I tried to show that with the controller so you can easily recognize what system you are going to play. Also it has a short description and info about that system.

This is only a Theme I have created for retropie. By using this artwork I assume you have the ownership and rights of all the games you are going to play. This is a free theme so you can not sell or make money with this.

# Features:

1080 resolution and smooth, with favorites, recent and library game list.
All sprites separated and the possibility to use a system dot indicator.
A power menu is included in case you have one


Designed by Chicuelo (Nico La Rosa)

# Special Thanks:

EctoOne and Keygan for giving me a huge help on the implementation of the theme.
I'm very thankful for having the chance to work with you guys!

# Notes:

The dot indicator is not included in the Theme, its just a fake indicator made for my systems, so it won't work fine on your setup.
Game screens are not included with the theme, you can scrape your own or use the game box art that it should work fine.

FOR A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE DISABLE ON-SCREEN HELP, SET THE UI TRANSITION STYLE TO INSTANT AND LOGO TRANSITIONS TO NONE
